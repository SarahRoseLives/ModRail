# ModTrack - OpenTTD Moderation Bot

ModTrack is an OpenTTD moderation bot designed to keep your server on track! (Pun Intended)

## What Happened to The Code?

I'm starting over (for like the 4th time) currently there is only a basic chat bridge implemented but I am going to make it feature-rich. The re-writes to get the base function where I want has taken forever but we're getting closer.
Stay Tuned for more updates!


## Get Involved

Please join our Discord if you're interested in this bot, how to use it, development or just having fun in OpenTTD in general.

Everything that runs on our OpenTTD server will be open source.

## Features Implemented

- A basic chat bridge which we can tie to specific channels
- An !admin / !report command that allows in-game players to ping a discord admin for help or reports.

## Features Planned

- Vote Kick and Vote Ban
- Connect multiple OpenTTD servers
- Query company statistics
- Link discord users or roles to in-game players? Maybe equate play time or in-game money to discord points?


## Dependencies

ModTrack utilizes the pyOpenTTDAdmin library, available at [liki-mc/pyOpenTTDAdmin](https://github.com/liki-mc/pyOpenTTDAdmin). Ensure you have this submodule included in your repository.
