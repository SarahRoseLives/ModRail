# ModTrack - OpenTTD Moderation Bot

ModTrack is an OpenTTD moderation bot designed to keep your server on track ~~by providing features such as vote kicking, banning, and filtering messages based on predefined word lists. It is configurable via a simple INI file.~~

## What Happened to The Code?

I'm starting over (for like the 4th time) currently there is only a basic chat bridge implemented but I am going to make it feature-rich. The re-writes to get the base function where I want has taken forever but we're getting closer.
Stay Tuned for more updates!

## Dependencies

ModTrack utilizes the pyOpenTTDAdmin library, available at [liki-mc/pyOpenTTDAdmin](https://github.com/liki-mc/pyOpenTTDAdmin). Ensure you have this submodule included in your repository.
